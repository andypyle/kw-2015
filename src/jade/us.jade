			p Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, 
				| has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to 
				| freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men 
				| turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many 
				| have died trying. And then here there can be no true 
				| despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will 
				| feed its people hope to poison their souls.

			p I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch 
				| them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can 
				| watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've 
				| truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill 
				| Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, 
				| when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes, then you 
				| have my permission to die.
